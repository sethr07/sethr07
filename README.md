- ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a Software Developer, with a passion for building and creating with code. On my profile, you'll find a variety of projects that showcase my skills in Python, C++/C, Verilog & Javascript. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow, so feel free to connect with me and collaborate on projects!
- Currently, I am working on a lightweight gmail client for MacOS using Python and Docker (gmail needs an app for Mac!!) that will enable me and people around me to quickly send emails without clicking so many buttons on Chrome! :)
