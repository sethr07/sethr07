Hi there! I'm Rahul, a software engineer from Trinity College, Dublin, with a passion for building software solutions. Currently, I'm focusing on developing software for embedded devices at Baker Hughes, where I'm gaining valuable experience in optimizing processes and enhancing efficiency.
With expertise in Python, C, C++, Verilog, and a working knowledge of JavaScript, I enjoy exploring various programming languages and technologies. I'm currently immersed in a personal project where I'm leveraging Python and LaTeX to build a Resume Builder. Additionally, I'm delving into the realm of Test Automation using GitHub workflows to enhance software quality and reliability.
I'm enthusiastic about continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in the software engineering field. Let's connect and collaborate on exciting projects, share ideas, and make an impact in the world of technology!
